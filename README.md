# Kinobuchungsprogramm

This repository contains a cinema booking program that was created as part of a project in the Programming 1 course. 
The creators are grilldb97 and SirPatschiii.

The project was realised with Python, including Tkinter, and has an object-oriented structure. The project was 
supported with a model-view-controller architecture. In addition, a database was integrated, which was realised 
with SQLite3.

The functions consist of a cinema selection, followed by a film selection including date and time. Finally, it is
possible to book one or more seats and finalise the booking with a summary.
